# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-22)

**Core value:** Covering the microphone reliably toggles the SteamVR dashboard, invisibly to the rest of VR — no controller beam, no extra hardware, no focus loss.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Driver Sidecar Migration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Driver Sidecar Migration)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-22 — Roadmap created, 31 requirements mapped across 5 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rip out virtual-controller driver entirely — no fallback, no feature flag (SVR-04).
- Adopt sidecar-on-HMD technique validated in bey-closer-t1 (`HMD Button Stub.md`).
- Use SteamVR-native auto-start (`app.vrmanifest`) — no Windows Run-key / Startup folder.
- Inno Setup installer patterned on `BeyondProximity.iss`, but MicMap owns its own driver directory (not nested).
- Fix stubbed JSON config read-back with already-vendored nlohmann/json.
- Phase 2 (Config Read-Back) is parallel-safe with Phase 1 (Driver Sidecar).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research-flagged validation spikes (budget by phase planners):

- **Phase 1:** HMD reactivation lifecycle (Case D) untested in bey-closer-t1 — validation spike required before phase exit.
- **Phase 3:** `SetApplicationAutoLaunch` persistence bug (OpenVR issue #1547) — multiple-restart UAT cycles needed.
- **Phase 4:** Upgrade-from-0.x ghost-binding cleanup (Pitfall 8) — requires real test machine with legacy driver installed. Inno Setup 6 Pascal Script gotchas (Pitfall 16) warrant half-day buffer.
